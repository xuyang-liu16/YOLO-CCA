## Overview

In this work, we introduce a novel vehicle detection algorithm called YOLO-CCA inspired by channel attention technique. Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Encoder-Decoder modules are adopted into YOLO-CCA algorithm for vehicle detection. With the introduction of the Complete-IoU (CIoU) loss function, the convergence rate is also accelerated. YOLO-CCA algorithm is capable of capturing cross-channel information and maximizing it, which leads to high accuracy for vehicle detection, especially for small vehicle targets detection.
